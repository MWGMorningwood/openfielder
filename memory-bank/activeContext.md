# Active Context

## Current Session Focus
**Date**: June 12, 2025  
**Task**: Azure Maps Geocoding Implementation & Map Component Stability

## Immediate Tasks
1. ✅ Fix backend geocoding service to use correct Azure Maps API
2. ✅ Update geocoding authentication to use DefaultAzureCredential
3. ✅ Implement robust error handling with retry logic
4. ✅ Resolve map component timing issues with source/layer addition
5. ✅ Fix Azure Maps bounds calculation
6. ✅ Update memory bank documentation to reflect current state

## Session Notes

### Major Issues Resolved
- **Backend Geocoding**: Migrated from deprecated Search API to Geocoding API 2025-01-01
- **Authentication**: Switched to DefaultAzureCredential for Azure Maps access
- **Map Timing**: Implemented promise-based readiness detection with buffer delays
- **Bounds Calculation**: Fixed Azure Maps bounds format from coordinate arrays to [west, south, east, north]

### Technical Improvements Made
- Enhanced error handling with specific error types and retry logic
- Added comprehensive logging for debugging geocoding and map issues
- Implemented exponential backoff with jitter for API failures
- Created robust map readiness detection to prevent timing errors

### Current State
- Geocoding backend is fully functional and returning correct coordinates
- Map bounds calculation is working properly
- Map source addition timing has been significantly improved (minor issues may remain)
- Error handling is comprehensive with user-friendly feedback

## Key Code Patterns Established

### Geocoding Service Pattern
```typescript
// Updated to use structured address parameters
const params = new URLSearchParams({
  'api-version': '2025-01-01',
  'addressLine': `${address.street1}${address.street2 ? ' ' + address.street2 : ''}`,
  'locality': address.city,
  'adminDistrict': address.state,
  'postalCode': address.zipCode,
  'countryRegion': 'US'
});
```

### Map Readiness Pattern
```typescript
// Promise-based map readiness with delay buffer
const addSourcesAndLayers = async () => {
  if (mapReadyPromiseRef.current) {
    await mapReadyPromiseRef.current;
  }
  await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, 1000));
  // Add sources/layers...
};
```

### Error Handling Pattern
```typescript
// Exponential backoff with jitter
private async retryOperation<T>(
  operation: () => Promise<T>,
  maxRetries: number = 3,
  delay: number = 1000
): Promise<T> {
  for (let attempt = 0; attempt <= maxRetries; attempt++) {
    try {
      return await operation();
    } catch (error) {
      if (attempt === maxRetries || !this.isRetryableError(error)) {
        throw error;
      }
      const backoffDelay = delay * Math.pow(2, attempt) + Math.random() * 1000;
      await new Promise(resolve => setTimeout(resolve, backoffDelay));
    }
  }
}
```

## Next Session Preparation
- Monitor map component for any remaining timing issues
- Consider implementing map component unit tests
- Plan for deployment testing of geocoding service
- Review performance implications of 1-second delay in map initialization
