# Active Context

## Current Session Focus
**Date**: June 11, 2025  
**Task**: Creating comprehensive instruction documentation for Azure SWA + Functions with Entra Auth

## Immediate Tasks
1. ✅ Create core memory bank files (systemPatterns, progress, productContext, decisionLog)
2. ✅ Generate detailed Azure SWA + Functions instruction file
3. ✅ Validate instructions against current project structure
4. ✅ Update memory bank with new documentation patterns
5. ✅ Establish memory bank usage guidelines

## Session Notes

### Key Insights from Project Analysis
- Project already has solid foundation with SWA + Functions architecture
- Authentication is properly implemented using SWA built-in auth with Entra ID
- TypeScript consistency across frontend and backend
- Service layer pattern well established
- Table Storage integration functional

### Documentation Patterns Established
- **systemPatterns.md**: Architectural decisions, naming conventions, code patterns
- **progress.md**: Sprint tracking, completed tasks, priorities
- **productContext.md**: Business logic, user requirements, feature specs
- **decisionLog.md**: Technical decisions with rationale and alternatives
- **activeContext.md**: Session focus and temporary notes

### Next Session Preparation
- Instruction file should cover full development workflow
- Include specific code patterns from current implementation
- Provide step-by-step setup and deployment procedures
- Cover security best practices and common pitfalls

## Temporary Notes
- User wants comprehensive instructions for Azure SWA + Function combinations
- Must include full Entra Auth integration
- Should cover React-related frameworks (current: React + TypeScript + Vite)
- Instructions should be actionable and detailed
- Include both development and production considerations

## Code Snippets for Reference
```typescript
// Current auth service pattern
export class AuthService {
  private static instance: AuthService;
  async getUserInfo(): Promise<ClientPrincipal | null> {
    const response = await fetch('/.auth/me');
    // Implementation details...
  }
}
```

```json
// SWA config pattern
{
  "routes": [
    { "route": "/api/*", "allowedRoles": ["authenticated"] }
  ],
  "navigationFallback": { "rewrite": "/index.html" }
}
```

## Action Items for Next Sessions
- [ ] Validate instruction completeness against real project needs
- [ ] Create template files for new SWA + Functions projects
- [ ] Document common troubleshooting scenarios
- [ ] Add monitoring and performance optimization guidance
